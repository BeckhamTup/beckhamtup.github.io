		<p>Currently enrolled on a Computer Science course as that is what I enjoy doing. I take pride in learning. If I don't know something, I will work until I do.This has been the case with many coding/markup langauges including HTML and CSS. I believe my qualifications reflects that I am willing to learn and grow within my field. <br><br>Previous to University, I worked a Food Factory for 2 years doing data input, I do not shy away from long hours on the computer if there is work to be done. While at University I have worked in 4 seperate bars, communicating with customers and staff is key in that line of work to keep things running smoothly and I apply those communication skills wherever I work. </p>
